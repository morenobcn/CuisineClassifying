Either by hand or with a pastry cutter , cut in the shortening till the mixture is crumbly . If the mixture looks more floury than crumbly , be sure to add just one or two more tablespoons of shortening till it is crumbly . Add about 3/4 cup hot water to the mixture , or just enough to make the ingredients look moist . With your hand or a large fork , knead the mixture making sure to rub the dough against the sides of the large mixing bowl to gather any clinging dough . If the dough still sticks to the side of the bowl , add a couple more tablespoons of flour until the dough forms a soft round shape .

Lightly flour your rolling area , and roll each ball with a rolling pin to about 1/8 inch thickness . Place each tortilla on a medium hot cast iron skillet .
