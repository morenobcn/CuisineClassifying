1 large eggplant 1 head garlic 1 tablespoon refined olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 tablespoons tahini 1 teaspoon SplendaÂ® (optional) salt and pepper to taste  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F . Pierce the skin of the eggplant in 6 to 10 places with a knife . This will prevent the eggplant from exploding . Place on a roasting pan . Place in a 375 degrees F oven and roast for 30 minutes . With good knife , cut off the top 1/2 inch of the head of garlic exposing the fleshy tops of most of the cloves . Thoroughly coat the garlic with the olive oil and place on the roasting pan next to the eggplant for the last 20 minutes of cooking . Remove eggplant and garlic and let cool . Once the eggplant is cool enough to handle , peel off and discard the skin and place the flesh in a colander and allow it drain for about 10 minutes . Meanwhile , pull apart the garlic cloves . A simple squeeze at the bottom of each clove should easily render the roasted flesh . Set this aside . (You probably won't use all of the roasted garlic for this recipe so store the remainder in a small jar and drizzle olive oil over it . Try to use it up within a few days.) I prefer to mix this in a food processor but it can be done by hand too . Add the eggplant , lemon juice , tahini and about 2 or 3 tsps of the roasted garlic . Blend well . Taste test and add more garlic if desired as well as some salt and pepper . If the eggplant is a little bitter , then add a tsp of Splenda .
