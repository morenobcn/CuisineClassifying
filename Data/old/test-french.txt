For the Poolish : 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast 1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 3/4 cup whole wheat flour For the Dough : 2 1/2 cups warm water 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast 6 cups unbleached bread flour 1 tablespoon kosher salt 2 tablespoons cornmeal for dusting  To make the sponge , whisk the 1/2 teaspoon yeast in 1/2 cup warm water . Stir in the whole wheat flour until the mixture resembles a thick batter . Beat for about 100 strokes to form longs strands of gluten . Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let sit at room temperature for 2 to 8 hours (longer is better for flavor development) . You can also let the poolish ripen in the refrigerator for 12 to 15 hours , bringing it back to room temperature before proceeding with the recipe .

Shape the dough into a round and cover with a damp cloth for 5 to 10 minutes . Place the dough in an oiled bowl , turning to coat the surface of the dough with oil . Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size , about 2 to 3 hours . Deflate the dough and cut it into two pieces . Shape the dough into two rounds , cover them with plastic or a damp cloth , and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature . Shape the dough into baguettes . Place a heavily floured cloth on a baking sheet , arranging a fold down the center to separate the loaves . Place the loaves , seam-side up , on the floured cloth . Dust the tops of the loaves with flour , cover with a damp towel , and let rise until doubled in bulk again , about two hours . Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) . Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal . Gently transfer the risen loaves to the baking sheet , placing them seam-side down on the cornmeal . Make several diagonal slashes in the loaf with a serrated knife or razor blade . Immediately place the scored loaves in the preheated oven . Bake the bread until the loaves are golden brown , about 25 to 30 minutes . Cool the loaves on wire racks .
