2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter , at room temperature 4 cups all-purpose flour , divided 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons sugar 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast 1/4 cup lukewarm water 1 cup milk 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 egg 1 tablespoon water  Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the butter and mix it together with your hands in a mixing bowl or on a work surface . Transfer the butter to a length of foil or parchment paper and pat it into a 6 inch square . Fold up the foil to make a packet and refrigerate until chilled , about 2 hours . Combine 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl . Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C) and set aside until frothy , about 10 minutes . Meanwhile , warm the milk and the heavy cream to lukewarm . Add the yeast , milk , and cream to the flour mixture and stir well . The dough will have a batter-like consistency . Stir in the remaining 2 cups of flour 1/4 cup at a time to form a soft dough . It should no longer be sticky . Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth , about 5 minutes . Place the dough in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Refrigerate for 1 hour . To begin the rolling and folding process , both the butter and the dough should be at a cool room temperature . [See Cook's Note.] Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it into a 10-inch square . Set the block of butter diagonally on the square dough . Bring each point of dough to the center of the butter square ; the edges of the dough should overlap . Pinch the edges together to seal . Starting from the center of the square and working outward , use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle . The butter should be pliable enough to roll smoothly with the dough ; if it's too soft and starts to ooze out the corners , wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate before proceeding . Roll the dough into a long rectangle , approximately 8 by 18 inches . Fold the length of dough into thirds , like a business letter . If the dough is still cool , you can continue with another fold . Otherwise , wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour . Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm up for about 10 minutes before you begin rolling it out again . Position the dough so that the open ends are at 12 and 6 o'clock . Roll the dough into a rectangle , working from the center of the dough and pressing outwards . Reposition the dough as necessary to fit your work space . You should have a long rectangle for the "book fold." Fold both ends of the dough into the middle ; the ends don't have to be touching , but should be close . Fold the already-folded dough in half ; it will look like a thick book . Wrap the dough well with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours . Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes . Roll the dough into a rectangle again and fold it into thirds , like a business letter . Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 4-6 hours or overnight . To shape the croissants , roll the dough into a 10- by 38-inch rectangle on a lightly floured work surface . It should be about 1/4 inch thick . Use a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough . Divide the rectangle in half so that you have two 5-inch wide strips of dough . Use a clean yardstick to mark each strip into triangles that are 5 inches wide at their bases . Cut the triangles and place them onto parchment-lined baking sheets . Chill for 15 to 20 minutes , if necessary . Starting at the base of the triangle , roll the dough up into a log ; the tip of the triangle should be under the body of the croissant to prevent it from unraveling . Bend in the corners to form the traditional crescent shape . Repeat with the remaining dough . Arrange the croissants on the parchment-lined baking sheets and allow to rise until doubled in size , about 1 to 2 hours . Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) . Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash . Brush the croissants with egg wash and bake in the preheated oven until deep brown , 22 to 25 minutes . Cool on a rack before serving .
